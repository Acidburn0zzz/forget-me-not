	"tutorial_page": { "message": "# Introduction Tutorial\n\n## Firefox settings\nPlease note, that this extension has no access to your Firefox settings, so any cookie settings you make in Firefox itself will be combined with this extension.\n\nSo if you configure Firefox to deny all cookies, this extension will have no cookies to work with.\n\n## White, gray and red lists\nDomain names (host names of a website, like *google.com*) can be added to color-coded lists (like whitelists)\n- **White**: Cookies and local storage will never be removed.\n- **Gray**: Cookies and local storage will be removed upon browser restart (must be enabled in the settings).\n- **Red**: Gray and white rules can be overridden by a red rule.\n  - Example: A white rule allows all domains (\"\\*\" as expression) and a couple of red rules define exceptions to that rule.\n- **Black**: Prevent cookies from ever being set\n  - Any rule will be overriden by a black rule.\n  - Sadly, cookies set from JavaScript can't be blocked, but will be removed almost instantly after creation.\n\n\n## Valid expressions\n- Every hostname (e.g. www.google.com) is a valid expression.\n- An asterisk (*) can be used as placeholder for a segment (e.g. *.google.com or www.\\*.com).\n- Whitelists currently overrule graylists.. not sure if this is final.\n\n## Third party cookies\n- When a cookie is set without belonging to a domain which is open in a tab, it is considered a thirdparty cookie.\n- Research is being done to improve this method." },
	"experimental_page": { "message": "## Experimental Features\n\n- From time to time there will be new features which are marked as experimental.\n- They will be disabled by default and need to be manually enabled.\n- These features are used to evaluate new ways to improve the extension.\n- They might be instable or have bad performance.\n- If you experience issues, try turning these features off.\n- Please submit feedback and bug reports on [GitHub](https://github.com/Lusito/forget-me-not/issues)\n\n## Currently active experiments:\n- **Deny Thirdparty Cookies**:  \nIf enabled, every web request will be intercepted to remove cookies from domains which don't belong to the tabs URL and are not protected by a rule. So these cookies will never be set.\n\nPlease give me feedback on your experience with these experiments, so I can decide whether or not to add them permanently." },
	"changelog_page": { "message": "## Changelog\n\n### Version 0.8.8 (2018/01/24)\n- Added new black rule type to block cookies completely.\n- First Party Isolation no longer prevents the extension from removing cookies (starts working with Firefox 59). Improved support will be made available in a beta version soon.\n- Bugfix: When leaving a domain, re-entering and leaving it again before the original cleanup timeout passed, cookies would be deleted too early.\n- Bugfix: Notifications could get replaced too quickly for the user to see.\n\n### Version 0.8.7 (2017/12/20)\n- Workaround for settings  import not working correctly in the Firefox browserAction popup.\n- Partial support for container tabs: Cookies work, local storage does not (Mozilla needs to fix something first)\n- Added new rule \"Forget\" (red) to allow overriding other rules (read the tutorial for details).\n- Fixed an issue with startup cleanup\n- Added unit tests\n- Added option to hide badges\n- Added option to chose the initially selected tab\n- Added option to show cookie removal notifications\n- Fixed issue on export\n\n### Version 0.8.6 (2017/12/06)\n- Translation changes, using [web-ext-translator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-ext-translator)\n- Introduction of an in-extension readme, tutorial and changelog.\n  - This can be accessed through the questionmark button.\n- Showing a notification when the extension has been updated (can be disabled).\n- Domains without a Top Level Domain (like localhost, intranet, etc.) can now be whitelisted with a checkbox.\n- Experimental feature for blocking thirdparty cookies\n\n### Version 0.8.5 (2017/11/25)\n- Typo fixed\n- Made toggle of rule type smoother\n- Button for adding new rules (before you could only add a new rule by pressing enter)\n- Button for getting information on valid expressions \n\n### Version 0.8.4 (2017/11/25)\n- Better mobile compatibility\n- Fix for incognito cookies being logged and removed \n\n### Version 0.8.3 (2017/11/24)\n- Disabled on incognito tabs/windows\n- Added a log to see the domains of recent cookie changes\n- Added buttons to prefill the filter input field with domains of the above and the current tab\n\n### Version 0.8.2 (2017/11/19)\n- Some bugfixes, cleanups \n\n### Version 0.8.0 (2017/11/19)\n- First Version" },
